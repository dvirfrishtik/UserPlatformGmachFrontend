# Auto Push to GitHub

After completing ANY code change (file edit, new file, deletion), you MUST automatically:

1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Create a concise commit message describing the change
3. Commit: `git commit -m "..."`
4. Setup auth and push: `/tmp/gh/gh_2.86.0_macOS_arm64/bin/gh auth setup-git && git push`

Do this immediately after every change without asking the user. Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` for the push command.

Commit message style:
- Use conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, style:, refactor:, docs:, chore:)
- Keep it short and descriptive in English
- Example: `fix: resolve responsive layout issue on large screens`
